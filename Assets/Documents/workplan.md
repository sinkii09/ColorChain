## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Performance on low-end devices**: Use object pooling, limit particles
2. **WebGL audio delays**: Preload audio, use compressed formats
3. **Touch input lag**: Optimize input detection, reduce UI complexity
4. **Chain algorithm complexity**: Limit max chain length, optimize recursion

### Backup Plans
- Simplify visual effects if performance issues arise
- Remove complex power-ups if implementation takes too long
- Focus on core gameplay if time constraints appear

---

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- ✅ Functional chain reaction gameplay
- ✅ Score system with timer
- ✅ Basic UI (menu, game, game over)
- ✅ Builds run on WebGL and Android

### Stretch Goals
- Advanced visual effects and animations
- Additional power-ups or game modes
- Sound design and music integration
- Leaderboard system (local)

### Final Deliverables
1. **WebGL build** ready for web hosting
2. **Android APK** ready for testing/distribution
3. **Source code** organized and documented
4. **Asset package** with all optimized resources
