# Safe Area Setup Guide

## Simple Setup (Just 3 Steps!)

### Step 1: Canvas Setup
```
Canvas (Screen Space - Overlay)
└── GameplayHUD (with SafeArea component)
    ├── TopBar
    │   ├── ScoreUIPanel
    │   └── TimerUIPanel
    └── BottomBar
        └── PowerUpUIPanel
```

### Step 2: Add SafeArea Component
1. Select your **GameplayHUD** GameObject
2. Add the **SafeArea** component
3. That's it! The component automatically adjusts to any device

### Step 3: Configure Child UI Elements
Make sure your UI panels inside GameplayHUD use proper anchors:
- TopBar: Anchor to top, stretch width
- BottomBar: Anchor to bottom, stretch width
- Side elements: Anchor to respective sides

## How It Works
- The SafeArea component automatically detects device safe areas
- Updates when device orientation changes
- Works on all devices: iPhones with notch, Android with cutouts, iPads, etc.
- No configuration needed!

## Testing
1. **Unity Editor**: Use Device Simulator (Window > General > Device Simulator)
2. **Real Device**: Build and test on actual devices
3. **Unity Remote**: Quick testing on connected devices

## That's All!
No complex setup, no device databases, no manual configuration. Unity's `Screen.safeArea` handles everything automatically.
